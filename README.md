A C++ program


Note: must have Microsoft Visual Studio to open this code( Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 was used)

  This is a menu driven C++ program that uses user-defined functions, arrays, and a random number generator function to fill an array with
	values. Upon execution of the program, the menu will be displayed in the middle of the screen. The program prompts the user to choose
	the number of elements to examine from the array. The maximum number of elements in the array are 30. Then the user is prompted for the 
	range of values of type double to fill the array. The largest number is found out of the array values and the its frequency. The program
	then displays the array with values, the largest number, and its frequency.
